                <p class="story">'' Our story started with a small team of friends who loved working with technology. We had one goal — to build something useful and meaningful. In the beginning, we had only a few tools and a lot to learn. But we believed in ourselves and worked hard every day. With each step, we learned new things and improved what we were doing.
                    As time went on, our team became stronger, and our projects grew bigger. We faced many challenges, but we never gave up. We supported each other and worked as a team to find solutions. We listened to feedback, made changes, and always tried to do our best. That helped us grow not just as a team, but also as people. ''</p> <br>
                <p class="storyw">'' Today, we are proud of how far we have come. We continue to work with the same passion and energy we had from the start. Our goal is to keep learning, keep improving, and keep helping others with the work we do. This journey is more than just creating software — it's about growing together and making a positive impact on the world.
                    Looking ahead, we are excited for what the future holds. We want to explore new ideas, take on new challenges, and work with more people who share our vision. No matter how big we grow, we will always remember our roots and the teamwork that brought us here. The best is yet to come. ''</p>
